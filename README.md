# Social-Network-API

## Description
  For this project, I made an API for a social network site that allows people to make users from which they can add fellow users as friends. An additional feature is the the ability to post thoughts. Users are able to post thoughts from which other users can add a reaction to the thought. All these aspects, the user, friends, thoughts, and reactions, are able to be modified through CRUD, Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This project allowed me to learn how to build an API and more specifically use the routes in order to enact the proper functions. This also helped me get better with models and creating the correct schemas that any client would require. This also strengthend my ability to create the proper javascript files in the controller aspect of APIs.
